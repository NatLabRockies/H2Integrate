description: "Demonstrates multivariable streams connecting a gas producer to consumer"

# Multivariable stream connections: specifying 'wellhead_gas' as the
# connected_parameter automatically expands to connect all constituent
# variables (gas_flow, hydrogen_fraction, oxygen_fraction, gas_temperature,
# gas_pressure) from source to destination.
