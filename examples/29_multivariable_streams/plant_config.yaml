description: "Demonstrates multivariable streams with a gas combiner"

# Multivariable stream connections with combiner:
# - Two producers feed into the gas_combiner
# - The combiner outputs a single combined stream to the consumer
# Format: [source, dest, stream_type, transport_type]
# The combiner automatically counts inputs like standard combiners do
technology_interconnections: [
  # Producer 1 -> Combiner (auto-counted as input 1)
  ["gas_producer_1", "gas_combiner", "wellhead_gas", "pipe"],
  # Producer 2 -> Combiner (auto-counted as input 2)
  ["gas_producer_2", "gas_combiner", "wellhead_gas", "pipe"],
  # Combiner -> Consumer
  ["gas_combiner", "gas_consumer", "wellhead_gas"],
