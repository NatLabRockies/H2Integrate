system_summary: >
  This example demonstrates the multivariable streams feature in H2Integrate.
  Multivariable streams allow users to connect multiple related variables with
  a single connection specification. In this example, we connect a wellhead_gas
  stream (containing gas_flow, hydrogen_fraction, oxygen_fraction, gas_temperature,
  and gas_pressure) between a dummy gas producer and consumer.
